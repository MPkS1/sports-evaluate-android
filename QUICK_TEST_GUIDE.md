## 🛠️ **Temporary Fix for Photo Requirement**

Since the photo upload is mandatory, here's a quick workaround:

### **Option 1: Modify Code Temporarily**
I can modify the validation to make photo optional for testing.

### **Option 2: Use Any Image**
1. When you reach the image upload section
2. Click the upload area
3. Select ANY image from your phone gallery
4. Even a screenshot or random photo will work

### **Option 3: Skip Photo Validation**
Would you like me to temporarily disable the photo requirement in the code so you can test without uploading images?

## 📱 **Expected Test Flow:**
```
Register → Verify Code → 
Fill Profile (with dummy data) → 
Dashboard → Success! ✅
```

## 🎯 **Test Validation Points:**

### ✅ **What Should Work:**
- Registration creates account
- Code verification within 60 seconds
- Form navigation between screens
- Data persistence across screens
- Dashboard displays entered information

### ⚠️ **Known Limitation:**
- Photo upload is currently required
- Can use any random image for testing

Would you like me to **temporarily modify the code** to make photo upload optional for testing? This would make testing much faster and easier! 🚀
